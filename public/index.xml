      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Ed.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently a junior at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, where I study electrical engineering.
My main hobby is tinkering. I&amp;rsquo;ve been the go-to in my house for anything broken since I was about 8 years old. I&amp;rsquo;ve done everything from replacing a lightbulb to replacing an SMD MOSFET on a treadmill&amp;rsquo;s circuit board. I pride myself on the fact that there is nothing I can&amp;rsquo;t build or fix without enough time or money.</description>

      <description>My couch is one of my favorite projects. I built it almost completely from scratch. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if that has ever been done before, but when I was researching during the design phase I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find much information about couch construction.
If anyone else finds this, let it be known that there are a lot of things I would do differently in v2. see the end of this post for more on that</description>
