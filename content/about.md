I'm Ed.

I'm currently a junior at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana,
where I study electrical engineering.

My main hobby is tinkering. I've been the go-to in my house for anything broken
since I was about 8 years old. I've done everything from replacing a lightbulb
to replacing an SMD MOSFET on a treadmill's circuit board. I pride myself on
the fact that there is nothing I can't build or fix without enough time or
money.

I like playing basketball and volleyball, but I prefer watching football and
baseball. Weird, I know. My favorite teams are the White Sox, the Bears, and
the Fighting Irish. I love to debate sports, especially that MJ is the GOAT and
that the Cubs are a terrible franchise.

Most of all, I like to learn. I try to do it whenever I can, and if I find the
time then some of that learning will be documented here.
